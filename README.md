## Introduction ðŸŽ‰
Hospital Management System is an information system designed to support the management of patient information and healthcare in hospitals. This system allows healthcare professionals to log into the system, update patient information, and review the medical history of each patient.
In addition, the system also provides functions for drug management, prescription writing, and storage of test results and diagnoses by doctors. As a result, information related to patients' health will be managed more effectively, allowing healthcare workers to provide the best possible care to patients.
<p>This system will be mainly used by:</p>
<ul><li>Employee</li><li>Patient</li><li>MedicalExamination</li><li>Drug</li><li>Service</li><li>Bill Service</li></ul>

<p>The hospital management system we have developed is a desktop application built using Java Swing and the Maven project management tool. Based on the project requirements, we have categorized our system into the following main functions:

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Patient management:</strong> allows for adding, editing, and deleting <a class="Markdown_link__9ACHA MarkdownLink_linkifiedLink__KxC9G" node="[object Object]" prompt="Tell me more about patient information.">patient information</a>, including name, age, gender, <a class="Markdown_link__9ACHA MarkdownLink_linkifiedLink__KxC9G" node="[object Object]" prompt="Tell me more about phone number.">phone number</a>, address, medical history, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow-up appointment management:</strong> enables scheduling follow-up appointments for patients, updating follow-up information, and notifying patients of their follow-up schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee management:</strong> allows for adding, editing, and deleting employee information, including name, position, phone number, address, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medication management:</strong> allows for adding, editing, and deleting medication information, including medication name, ingredients, usage instructions, inventory quantity, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service management:</strong> allows for adding, editing, and deleting service information, including service name, price, usage time, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medical record management:</strong> allows for storing medical record information, including symptoms, test results, prescriptions, doctor's advice, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invoice management:</strong> allows for storing invoice information, including information on services and medications used by the patient, cost, usage time, etc.</p>
